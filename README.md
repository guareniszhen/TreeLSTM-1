# TreeLSTM with Pytorch
This is a pytorch implementation that tries to reproduce the experiments and the results in 
[Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075)
. We can basically get the same results with the results reported in the original paper and the 
original open sourced [implementaion](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/treelstm).
